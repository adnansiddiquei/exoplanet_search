%\section{MNIST Classifier Details}\label{app:mnist-classifier}
%The MNIST classifier model is a CNN composed of 4 \inlinecode{CNNBlocks} ($[32, 64, 128, 64]$ channels per block) followed by an
%\inlinecode{nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d} to lower the dimensionality of the penultimate feature vector to 1024 before it is fed into
%a fully connected \inlinecode{nn.Linear} layer with 10 output units (one for each class in the MNIST dataset).
%This classifier was trained for 21 epochs with a batch size of 128 and a learning rate of $2 \times 10^{-4}$ using the Adam optimiser.
%The loss function used was the cross-entropy loss function and the test set classification accuracy reached was 99.34\% on
%the final epoch.
%To extract the 1024-length feature vector, the final \inlinecode{nn.Linear} layer was set to \inlinecode{nn.Identity}
%so that the model outputted the penultimate layer feature vector instead of the class predictions.
%The model was trained on the MNIST training set and the test set was used for evaluation of the FMD.
